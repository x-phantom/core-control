## General
This is a Streamlined CLI-Based Core v2 Management Tool. 
- Installs fail2ban for ssh, and ufw allowing only port 22(ssh) and the cores ports.
- For start/restart/stop/status/logs you can skip the 'all' argument as it's the default.
- For install/remove you can skip the 'core' argument as it's the default.
- For update you can skip the 'check' argument as it's the default.
- For system you can skip the 'info' argument as it's the default.
- When setting a delegate secret just paste your secret after the 'set' argument without quotes.
- The snapshot is stored in the 'snapshots' folder in your home directory using the database name, e.g. ark_mainnet. 
If you're using an external snapshot make sure to rename it accordingly and put it in the 'snapshots' folder.
- Running with the 'remove' argument does not delete the 'snapshots' folder or the stored snapshot in order to allow you
to take a snapshot, do remove/install and restore it afterwards.
- The script adds an alias named 'ccontrol' on first run. On your next shell login you'll be able to call the script from anywhere
using: ccontrol arg1 [arg2]. It also has autocomplete functionality for all possible arguments.
- Using the 'config reset' arguments will stop the core processes, delete your existing configs and replace them with the defaults.
If you're running a forger and/or have custom settings, you should add them again.
- Do not run as root!
